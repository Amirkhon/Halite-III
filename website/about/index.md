<div class="doc-section" markdown="1">

Halite is an artificial intelligence programming challenge created by [Two Sigma](https://www.twosigma.com){:target="_blank"}, in which players build bots using the coding language of their choice to compete in an original online multiplayer game. Since 2016, more than 7,000 students and professionals around the world have played Halite, applying algorithms in a dynamic, open source game setting.


## Halite III

This year’s Halite challenge has a resource management premise and an ocean theme. Players build bots that efficiently navigate the seas collecting halite, a luminous energy resource. See our [Game Overview](/learn-programming-challenge/game-overview) to learn more about Halite III.

The Halite III competition runs from October 16th to January 22nd, and the winners will be announced January 29th. Players can join the competition any time, and will submit bots that play against each other on our game servers to determine rank. See [here](/play-programming-challenge) to learn more about how to play. As players improve and resubmit new versions of their bots, players can watch their progress on our [leaderboard](/leaderboard).

Halite I and Halite II were especially successful because of their excellent community contributions and robust forums. Any player, from beginner to advanced, can contribute to the [open source Halite III project](https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite-III/) or join the [forums](/forums) to ask questions or learn best practices.
